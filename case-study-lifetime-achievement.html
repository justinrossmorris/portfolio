          Overview
        </h2>
        <div class="pl-11 space-y-4 text-slate-300">
          <p>Insight CEO Joyce Mullen was selected for the industry's most prestigious lifetime achievement award for women in technology. The ceremony: a black-tie gala at Gotham Hall in New York City, with 400+ senior women leaders in attendance.</p>
          <p>Joyce needed an acceptance speech. Not a keynote, something shorter, more personal. Three minutes to capture 30+ years of career wisdom and leave the room moved.</p>
          <p>The stakes were high. This was her capstone moment, delivered just weeks after announcing her retirement. The speech had to honor her legacy while inspiring the next generation.</p>

          Challenge
        </h2>
        <div class="pl-11 space-y-4 text-slate-300">
          <p>Acceptance speeches are deceptively difficult:</p>
          <ul class="space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-blue-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>Brevity under pressure:</strong> Three minutes isn't much. Every sentence has to earn its place. No room for corporate filler.</span></li>
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-blue-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>Personal without being self-congratulatory:</strong> The audience came to celebrate Joyce, but she wanted to celebrate them. The speech had to redirect the spotlight.</span></li>
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-blue-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>Emotional resonance:</strong> This wasn't a business presentation. It needed to land in the heart, not just the head.</span></li>
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-blue-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>A story worth telling:</strong> We needed a narrative anchor, something memorable that would carry the message long after the applause.</span></li>

          Approach
        </h2>
        <div class="pl-11 space-y-4 text-slate-300">
          <p><strong>Finding the story:</strong> In preparing interview responses for the press coverage, we'd surfaced a story Joyce tells often, about being asked to fetch coffee at a meeting early in her career, only to take her seat at the table moments later as a key participant. The man who asked "wanted to disappear from embarrassment." She never said a word.</p>
          <p>This story had everything: humor, tension, a twist, and a powerful lesson about quiet confidence. It became the spine of the speech.</p>
          <p><strong>Structure design:</strong></p>
          <ol class="space-y-2 ml-4 list-decimal list-inside">
            <li><strong>The hook:</strong> Open with the coffee story. Make them lean in.</li>
            <li><strong>The pivot:</strong> "Here's what I've learned..." Shift from personal anecdote to universal truth.</li>
            <li><strong>The tribute:</strong> Turn the spotlight to the audience. "This community taught me."</li>
            <li><strong>The charge:</strong> Leave them with a call to action they can carry home.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Voice and delivery:</strong> I wrote stage directions into the script: [BREATH — TAKE IN THE ROOM], [BEAT — SLIGHT SMILE], [SLOW — SHIFT TONE]. These cues helped Joyce own the pacing and let the moments land.</p>

                "Early in my career, I had a meeting I'll never forget. I walked into the conference room with a strategy I'd been working on. Before we started... one of the men at the table looked at me and asked if I'd make him a coffee. He told me exactly how he liked it: two sugars, one cream.
                <br><br>
                So... I made the coffee.
                <br><br>
                I handed it to him. And then I took MY seat at the table.
                <br><br>
                I watched that man try to disappear into his chair for the rest of the meeting."

        </h2>
        <div class="pl-11 space-y-4 text-slate-300">
          <p><strong>The speech landed.</strong> The trade publication covering the event quoted extensively from the speech in their feature article, using it to close their coverage:</p>
          <blockquote class="bg-slate-800/50 rounded-lg p-4 border-l-2 border-emerald-500 my-4">
            <p class="text-white">"The next time someone underestimates you, and they will, don't waste your energy on an argument. Make the coffee. Serve it with a smile. Be the person who knows exactly where you belong."</p>
            <p class="text-slate-400 text-sm mt-2">From the event coverage</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The coffee story became the defining narrative of the evening. Colleagues who attended reported it was the moment people were talking about afterward.</p>
          <p>More importantly: this was Joyce's last major public speech as CEO. The words had to be worthy of the moment. They were.</p>

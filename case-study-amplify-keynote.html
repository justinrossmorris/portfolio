          Overview
        </h2>
        <div class="pl-11 space-y-4 text-slate-300">
          <p>A newly hired SVP was scheduled to deliver his first keynote at the company's annual sales kickoff — the biggest internal event of the year. He'd been in the role for just 122 days.</p>
          <p>The stakes: introduce himself to 1,500+ field sellers, establish credibility, drive enthusiasm for a new go-to-market strategy, and bring a customer on stage for a live fireside chat. All in 25 minutes.</p>
          <p>His mantra: "Refuse to lose." The challenge: turn that energy into a speech that would make an entire salesforce feel the same way.</p>

      <!-- Challenge -->

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 flex items-center gap-3">

          Challenge
        </h2>
        <div class="pl-11 space-y-4 text-slate-300">
          <p>This wasn't a typical keynote. The complexity came from multiple angles:</p>
          <ul class="space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-blue-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>New executive, high exposure:</strong> His first time on the company's biggest stage. The audience would be evaluating him as much as listening to him.</span></li>
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-blue-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>Complex strategic messaging:</strong> The content involved technical concepts (infrastructure, AI transformation) that had to land for a sales audience without getting into the weeds.</span></li>
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-blue-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>Customer fireside embedded:</strong> A CIO would join him on stage for a live Q&A. The questions had to be sharp enough to elicit real insights but flexible enough for natural conversation.</span></li>
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-blue-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>High-energy delivery expectations:</strong> He's a dynamic speaker who feeds off the room. The script couldn't feel scripted — it had to give him room to move.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Approach -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 flex items-center gap-3">
          <span class="w-8 h-8 rounded-full bg-purple-500/20 flex items-center justify-center text-purple-400 text-sm">3</span>
          Approach
        </h2>
        <div class="pl-11 space-y-4 text-slate-300">
          <p><strong>Finding the hook:</strong> In our early conversations, a theme emerged: he'd spent 25+ years at competitors and knew exactly how they operate. He wasn't just new to the company — he was a convert. That positioning became the foundation: "I've sat in the room with your competition. And I'm here to tell you: they don't have what we have."</p>

          <p><strong>The boxing metaphor:</strong> His personal mantra — "Refuse to lose" — suggested a competitive, fighting spirit. We built the entire talk around a boxing theme: fuchsia gloves, a Rocky-inspired entrance, and language about "getting in the ring" with customers.</p>

          <p><strong>Two-deck architecture:</strong> To give him maximum flexibility on stage, I built two synchronized decks:</p>
          <ul class="space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-purple-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>VISUALS deck</strong> (audience screen) — Clean, bold imagery. Minimal text. Let him be the show.</span></li>
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-purple-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>NOTES deck</strong> (confidence monitor) — Bullet-point prompts, not full scripts. Enough to keep him on track, loose enough to let him riff.</span></li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Iterative refinement:</strong> We went through 11 versions of the storyboard. Each iteration moved further from "script" toward "prompts." In our final prep call, he ran through the entire talk without slides — just from memory, using the structure we'd built together.</p>

          <p><strong>Fireside prep:</strong> For the customer Q&A, I developed 7 questions that moved through a clear arc: set the scene, surface the challenge, get to the "why us" moment, and close with advice for the room. I also briefed him on what to do if the customer was a no-show (backup plan: pull a sales leader from the audience).</p>

          The Deliverables
        </h2>
        <div class="pl-11 space-y-4 text-slate-300">
          <p>This project required more than a script. The full package included:</p>
          <ul class="space-y-2 ml-4">
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-rose-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>Speaker brief:</strong> A comprehensive document covering logistics, stage directions, contingency plans, and guidance for handling everything from time crunches to technical failures.</span></li>
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-rose-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>Storyboard:</strong> Visual-by-visual breakdown of the entire talk, including what's on screen, what's on the confidence monitor, and key talking points.</span></li>
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-rose-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>Fireside Q&A guide:</strong> Seven prepared questions with context, plus notes on what to avoid (customer NDAs, competitive landmines).</span></li>
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-rose-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>VISUALS deck:</strong> 72 slides for the audience screen — bold imagery, minimal text, designed for a speaker who owns the room.</span></li>
            <li class="flex items-start gap-2"><span class="text-rose-400 mt-1">•</span><span><strong>NOTES deck:</strong> Synchronized confidence monitor deck with bullet-point prompts and pacing cues.</span></li>

          Impact
        </h2>
        <div class="pl-11 space-y-4 text-slate-300">
          <p><strong>The entrance worked.</strong> When the Rocky theme hit and he walked out in fuchsia gloves, shadow boxing across the stage, the room came alive. He had them before he said a word.</p>
          <p>During our final prep call — two days before the event — he ran through the entire talk without slides. Just talking through the structure we'd built together. His feedback after that session:</p>
          <blockquote class="bg-slate-800/50 rounded-lg p-4 border-l-2 border-emerald-500 my-4">
            <p class="text-white">"Star performance, my friend. Star performance."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The real test: he made the material his own. By the time he took the stage, the script had become his voice. The prompts were just guardrails — he knew where he was going and how to get there.</p>
